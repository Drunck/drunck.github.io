    <p>At the beginning of XX century, livestock breeding continued to be the main type of economy in the steppe, and the Kazakh population continued to lead a nomadic way of life. The nomadic economy of the Kazakhs at the beginning of the century began to experience the impact of the Russian influence (market). A significant part of cattle-breeding farms was drawn into trade and market relations.</p>
    <p>Expansion of contacts with the Russian market and fairs changed the structure of the herd in Kazakh farms towards an increase in the number of horses and cattle.</p>
    <p>New forms of economy were formed: settled cattle-breeding and sedentary agricultural. In its pure form, the nomadic economy remained in the steppe regions.</p>
    <p>In the northern regions it was already rare to find a purely nomadic economy not connected with agriculture (grain)</p>
    <p>Although the number of Kazakhs who began to sow the land as a whole increased, agriculture for them continued to be a secondary and auxiliary branch of the nomadic economy. It can also be concluded that the agrarian policy of the Russian administration as a whole did not stimulate the development of agriculture among the Kazakhs. A new phenomenon in the nomadic economy was that ruined nomadic herders went to work in cities, Cossack villages, resettlement villages (annually up to 20 thousand people)</p>
    <p>The most important result of the accession of Kazakhstan to Russia was the gradual pulling of the region into the all-Russian market and commodity-money relations. Kazakhstan is turning into a raw material base and a sales market for the Russian industry. The poorly developed industry of Kazakhstan was represented by mining, as well as processing and food enterprises.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of XX century, foreign entrepreneurs began to invest in mining enterprises (Altai and Central Kazakhstan). Thus, the Anglo-French joint-stock community of Spassky copper ores, which arose in 1904 in London, acquired the Spassko-Uspensky copper mine and plant, the Saransk-Karaganda coal mines, and iron mines In Western Kazakhstan and the Ural-Embensky region, joint-stock companies were engaged in the development of oil fields in which English capital predominated ("Ural-Embensky company", "West Ural oil company", etc.)</p>
    <p>Coal deposits (Karaganda, Ekibastuz) were actively developed, gold was mined, and the salt industry developed rapidly. Increased access to railways is a manifestation of Kazakhstan's pulling into the all-Russian market. At the beginning of the century, the construction of railways began, connecting the region with the industrial centers of Russia. The main railway at that time was the Orenburg-Tashkent road (1901-1905). Troitskaya, Altai and Semirechenskaya railways were built. Branches of the largest Russian banks are opened in Russian Commercial Industrial Bank, Russian-Asian Bank, Petersburg and others.</p>
    <p>The main goods were imported livestock and animal products.</p>
    <p>The development of industry and the construction of railways contributed to the formation of the working class, which in 1913 reached 75 thousand people</p>
    <p>In 1914 Russia entered the First World War. The war caused the collapse of industry, the decline of agriculture, transport and financial crises. The situation of the population of the region has worsened. For the needs of the warriors of the population at compulsory prices, they bought up livestock, requisitioned food, yurts and felt.</p>
    <p>The beginning of the 1916 national liberation uprising took place.</p>
    <p>The main reasons for the uprising: increased colonial oppression, the seizure of land from the indigenous population, an increase in taxes and levies, a sharp deterioration in the situation of the Kazakh population in connection with the war.</p>
    <p>The reason for the rebellion was the Tsar’s decree of June 25, 1916. On the call for the rear work of the Kazakh male population (from 19 to 43 years old) for the construction of defensive structures in the battle area. The compilation of the lists, entrusted to the volost governors, led to massive bribery and abuse.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of July 1916 spontaneous uprisings began in almost all areas of the region, which grew into an armed uprising</p>
    <p>The largest centers of the uprising were the Turgai region and Semirechye. The uprising in the Semirechensk region (leaders T. Bokin and B. Ashekeyev) began in early July. A congress/meeting of Kazakhs took place on Ushkonur tract, at which it was decided not to send people to rear work, to destroy the telegraph, and to destroy the lists of mobilized people.</p>
    <p>To suppress the uprising, the government sent punitive troops. Large clashes with government troops took place in Kazalinsky, Aulie-Atinsky, Shymkent and Vernensky districts. In SeptemberOctober, a significant part of the Semirechye rebels, pressed from all sides by the tsarist troops, was forced to leave for Western China; some auls migrated to the Turgai region.</p>
    <p>The uprising in the Turgai region, led by A. Imanov and A. Dzhangildin, turned out to be the most long-lasting. The number of insurgents here reached 50 thousand people. The Turgai center of the uprising was distinguished by a well-coordinated control system of the insurrectionary movement. Commander Amangeldy Imanov divided the army into tens, fifty and hundreds and thousands.</p>
    <p>The military council (kenes) was in charge of military matters.</p>
    <p>The most important aspect of the uprising was that the rebels restored the traditional (pre-colonial) institutions of government and ceased to obey the colonial administration. Khans were elected from representatives of the aristocracy. Thus, the uprising, which began with a protest against the actions of the tsarist government, acquired the character of an anti-colonial, national liberation war of the Kazakh people. The insurgent had to fight the superior forces of the government. By the beginning of the February Revolution, the main detachments of the rebels were defeated.</p>
    <p>In February 1917, a revolution took place in Petrograd, overthrowing the monarchy. The weakness of Russian democracy was manifested in the fact that a dual power was established in Russia. The Provisional Government, representing the forces of democracy and capitalism, shared power with the Soviets of Workers ‘ and Soldiers’ Deputies, which became the center of concentration of pro-socialist populist forces, among which the Bolsheviks took over by the fall.</p>
    <p>In Kazakhstan, news of the events in Petrograd caused a wave of meetings and demonstrations in support of the revolution. In the region, as well as throughout the country, a dual power was established. The authorities representing the Provisional Government were formed in March-April 1917.</p>
    <p>The Provisional Government appointed former officials of the previous administration at the head of the regional authorities, and also attracted representatives of the Kazakh intelligentsia to the administration.</p>
    <p>A.Bukeikhanov was appointed commissar of Turgai region, and M. Tynyshpaev - the Semirechensk region In the volosts, auls, villages, the former volost and aul governors remained. Simultaneously with the authorities of the Provisional Government, in such cities as Verny, Semipalatinsk, Akmolinsk, Pavlodar and others, Soviets of Workers ‘ Deputies are convened, many of which soon united with the Soviets of Soldiers’ Deputies</p>
    <p>Creation of the party “Alash”</p>
    <p>For Kazakh society, the change in the political regime in Russia as a result of the February coup meant weakening and liberalization of colonial policy. The social and political life of Kazakhstan has noticeably revived during this period, new and old political, social and religious (mainly Muslim) organizations were actively created in the region</p>
    <p>The evidence of the activity of the Kazakh public is the creation of national political parties and movements.</p>
    <p>Kazakh democratic intelligentsia in July -1917 creates the political party "Alash" (leaders: Alikhan Bukeikhanov and Akhmet Baitursynov).</p>
    <p><b>The party set its main tasks:</b></p>
    <p>providing Kazakhstan with territorial-national autonomy, returning the land taken by the tsarist government and carrying out democratic reforms.</p>
    <p>Politically, "Alash" was close to the main Russian party of the bourgeoisdemocratic direction - the party of the Cadets (constitutional democrats) In December 1917, at the II All-Kazakh Congress, a decision was made on the formation of the Kazakh autonomy and the formation of its government. By the decision of the congress, the autonomy was to include the Bukeevskaya horde, the Ural, Turgai, Akmola, Semipalatinsk, Semirechensk regions, as well as areas of the Transcaspian region and Altai province inhabited by Kazakhs.</p>
    <p>An executive body "Alash Orda" was formed, which included 25 members, 10 of whom were representatives of other nationalities (efforts to develop democratic political party).</p>
    <p><b>Karkaraly petition dated July 22, 1905</b></p>
    <p>A.Baitursynov, A. Bukeikhanov, M. Dulatov, Zh. Akbaev and other Kazakh intellectuals wrote: “... when all of Russia declares the need for a complete reorganization of its life, the Kyrgyz (Kazakh) steppes, connected by fate with Russia, cannot remain indifferent to the events it experiences and not declare about their urgent needs ...”</p>
    <p>Requirements were put forward in the “Karkaralinskaya petition” granting freedom of conscience, organizing education of the population in their native language, rejecting resettlement policy, adopting a special legislative act on the ownership of the land fund by the indigenous population, revising the “Steppe Regulations” and the system of administrative management of the region, legislative consolidation of the right to conduct civil and judicial proceedings in the Kazakh language , reducing the number of officials of the colonial control, abandoning the practice of appointing governors-general from the center, and granting quotas in the supreme bodies of power for deputies from the colonial outskirts.</p>
    <p>The process of establishing a new government in Kazakhstan began in late October 1917 and lasted by March 1918</p>
    <p>On October 28 in Tashkent – the administrative center of the area and all Turkestan began an armed uprising which led to the establishment of Soviet power on November 1</p>
    <p>At the III Regional Congress of Soviets of Turkestan held on 15-21 Nov. 1917 in Tashkent, People’s Commissars “SovNarCom” were elected (Government of the Turkestan Republic). There was no even a single representative of the local Muslim population</p>
    <p>In response to it, on Nov.16, 1917 a congress of Kokand clericals (Muslim) organizations of Turkestan took place =>”Kokand Autonomy”. The members of its Provisional Government included the leaders of “Alash” M.Shokay and M.Tynyshpayev (*Effort to establish Kazakh statehood)</p>
    <p>***it was a short-lived autonomy => on Feb.2,1918 it was overthrown by the Soviet government</p>
    <p>On Dec.5-13, 1917 in Orenburg the All Kyrgyzs Congress took place => creation of the Kazakh Autonomy Alash Orda headed by A.Bokeykhanov=>adopted to form armed detachments</p>
    <p>The Bolsheviks saw a “reactionary counter-revolutionary organization” in the
        Alash Orda => they organized a broad propaganda among the Kazakh workers
        to expose Alash Orda members =></p>
    <p>On Dec.16, 1917 a demonstration of ten thousand Kazakh workers in Akmola
        => “Kyrgyz workers do not need the autonomy Alash Orda”</p>
    <p>On March 19, 1918 the Revolutionary Committee closed printing press of
        “Alash” in Vernyi; on April 1 property of the newspaper ”Kazakh” and printing
        press were confiscated by the decision of Torgay Regional Congress</p>
    <p>In the struggle for the victory of the Soviet power in the Kazakh steppe, the
        Bolsheviks came to temporary agreements with the Left SRs (socialist
        revolutioners), Mensheviks-Internationalists and the party “Ush Zhus” (Kazakh
        Socialist Party was created in 1917).
        </p>
    <p>On Dec. 27, 1917 a mass meeting of the workers of Akmola adopted a
        resolution on the transfer of power to the Soviets. </p>
    <p>On Nov.15, 1917 all power in Orenburg and Torgay center was in the hands of
        the counter-revolutionaries. Detachments of Baltic sailors, Petrograd Red
        Guards, the Volga region and Siberia region solders were sent against Dutov.
        Red guard detachments from Tashkent, Perovsk, Kazalinsk, Turkestan and Arys
        stations were sent to free Orenburg. </p>
    <p>On Jan. 18, 1918 Orenburg was liberated.</p>
    <p>The victory of the Soviet authorities in Orenburg was a great political
        significance.
        </p>
    <p>The direct railway Orenburg-Tashkent was restored connecting the central
        parts of the country with Central Asia and Kazakhstan</p>
    <p>A strong fight for the establishment of the Soviet power took place in
        Semirechensk. The officer kulak top of Semirechensk Cossaks established the
        White Guards’ dictatorship in its center – Vernyi, the “Semirechenskaya
        Peasant” newspaper was closed;
        </p>
    <p>Revolutionary-minded military units were disbanded</p>
    <p>The Bolsheviks had to go into hiding. After the victory of the revolution a task
        to reorganize the Soviets as organs of state power was on the agenda</p>
    <p>By the end of 1917, on Dec.22, two important documents of the Soviet
        government were made public=> Instruction “On the Rights and Obligations of
        the Soviets” and the appeal “To All the Soviets”
        </p>
    <p>They defined the issue of the relationship between the central government in
        the system of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and their close relationship
        with each other in a single centralized state system.</p>
    <p>The strengthening of the Soviet power could not be without laying the
        foundations of a socialist economy. A significant place in this case was given
        to workers’ control over production and distribution which served as
        transnational measure to the nationalization of industry and one of the
        conditions for the establishment of economic life</p>
    <p>Nationalization of the banks ensured the success of nationalization of industry
        and transport;
        </p>
    <p>In summer 1918, the Soviets of Kazakhstan nationalized the whole industry;</p>
    <p>The land issue was one of the urgent questions which had a direct impact on
        the consolidation of the Soviet power in Kazakh village because it is affected
        inter-ethnic relations;</p>
    <p>With respect to auls the nationalization of the land solved the problem of
        not only feudal but also anti-colonial, since under the terms of the Decree on
        Land, not only the removal of kazakhs of the best arable land and pastures
        was stopped, but previously snatched land was returned back to them.</p>
    <p>Local councils => supported cultural development. The main idea in the
        creation of the Soviet culture was the development of national
        education=>the first steps in rebuilding schools were taken
        </p>
    <p>Measures were taken to expand theirs networks, especially in Kazakh villages,
        to train teaching staff</p>
    <p>Aim =>availability of textbooks and school supply for all</p>
    <p>An important event in developing /restructuring of the school education
        system was the separation of church and state</p>
    <p>Schools were separated from the Church which was the beginning of the
        secular education</p>
    <p>Education in the native language was permitted</p>
    <p><b>Civil war 1918-1920</b></p>
    <p>Intransigent position of Bolsheviks and their political opponents led to the
        deployment of large-scale military operations throughout the country in
        spring 1918 = > the reason for the outbreak of the armed conflict was attempt
        to disarm the local Councils of the Czechoslovak Corps which consisted of
        formed Czechs and Slovak prisoners of war, and which was forwarded from
        Siberia and forwarded from Siberia via Vladivostok to Europe</p>
    <p>In October the Red Army launched an offense on all fronts. Kolchak’s army
        was demoralized. The main forces began to retreat Kazakh steppe</p>
    <p>During the war between Bolsheviks and their opponents Alash Orda lost
        control of most of the territory of Kazakhstan. Kolchak’s refusal to provide
        the autonomy to kazakhs, on the one hand, and the call of the Bolsheviks for
        self-determination of the people, on the other, brought to a crisis of Alash
        Orda in 1918-1919 and the end of Alash autonomy.
        </p>
    <p>After winning a military victory in the civil war, the Bolsheviks and their allies
        were taking measures to consolidate their legal authority in Kazakhstan</p>
    <p>The main causes of the crisis and the liquidation of Alash Orda were rejection
        of the idea of autonomy by its anti-Bolsheviks allies in the coalition and
        promise to provide the broader political rights to Kazakh people for selfdetermination by the Soviet authorities.
        </p>
    <p>Under the Civil war conditions, economic collapse and a lack of
        communication between the branches of Alash Orda => its leaders had no
        choice but to join the Soviets.</p>
    <p><b>Formation of the Kazakh Autonomous
        Soviet Socialist Republic (KazASSR)</b></p>
    <p>On August 26, 1920 All-Russian Central Executive and the Council of People’s
        Commissars issued decree “On Formation of the Kazakh Autonomous Soviet
        Socialist Republic” as a part of RSFSR which was the first federal socialist
        state built on the basis of the Soviet autonomy.</p>
    <p>From October 4 to 12,1920 a Constitutive Congress of the Soviets of the
        Kazakh ASSR was held in Orenburg. </p>
    <p>The congress elected a supreme authority – the Central Executive Committee
        and the Council of people’s Commissars of the Republic.
        </p>
    <p>Seytkali Mendeshev was elected the Chairman of the Council Election
        Commission of KazASSR</p>
    <p>The congress adopted the Workers’ Right Declaration of the KazASSR</p>
    <p>It assigned broad political rights to the working people of Kazakhstan</p>
    <p>Declaration served as a constitution (up to 1937)</p>
    <p>On August 26, 1920 All-Russian Central Executive and the Council of People’s
        Commissars issued decree “On Formation of the Kazakh Autonomous Soviet
        Socialist Republic as a part of RSFSR which was the first federal socialist state
        built on the basis of the Soviet autonomy.</p>
    <p>Seytkali Mendeshev was elected as the Chairman of the Council Election
        Commission of KazASSR</p>
    <p>This decree identified the territory of Kazakhstan stated that the formation of
        KazASSR were local councils, the CEC (Council of People’s Commissars) and
        Sovnarkom.</p>
    <p>A military commissariat was formed to control Kazakh military apparatus</p>
    <p>Upon completion of the national state-building in Central Asia and Kazakhstan, the
        people inhabited these regions were “separated” by the state borders. Two regions,
        Syrdarya and Semirechensk were inhabited by mostly Kazakhs however they remained
        a part of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.</p>
    <p>In this regard, in Oct.1924 the Soviet management made a national–territorial
        delimitation of the Central Asian Republics. Turkestan ASSR was abolished and divided
        into Uzbek and Turkmen Republic. A bit later the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan were
        formed.
        </p>
    <p>The southern areas (Semirechensk and Syrdarya regions) were returned to Kazakhstan.</p>
    <p>As a result of the delimitation
        (determination of state borders) the
        territory of Kazakhstan increased to
        2,8 mln sq km and become the second
        in size in the USSR (Dec.30,1922)</p>
    <p>Kazakhstan’s population grown to 6,5
        mln people</p>
    <p>Orenburg and part of the Orenburg
        province were transferred to Russia
        </p>
    <p>The capital of the Republic was moved
        from Orenburg to Kyzylorda in 1925</p>
    <p>On Apr.15-19, 1925 the V Congress of the Soviets of the Kazakh SSR was held in
        Kyzylorda => for the first time representatives from the whole Kazakhstan
        attended it.</p>
    <p>The congress determined the historically name of the people – Kazakhs.</p>
    <p>Thus, that the Kyrgyz Autonomous Soviet Soc.Republic (KASSR) was renamed in
        Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (KazASSR).</p>
    <p>(as you know in the 1st half of XVIII century and up until 1925 Kazakh were called
        Kyrgyz)</p>
    <p>The name of the new Republic was changed (Kyzylorda was capital until 1929)=>
        Alma-Ata (now Almaty)</p>
    <p><b>Historical significance of proclamation
        of the Kazakh Soviet national-statehood</b>
    </p>
    <p>Great historical significance => Kazakh people took this act as the result of
        centuries-old struggle with colonization => the first step on the path of
        national revival</p>
    <p>Formation of the Kazakh SSR, the 1st social, economic transformation of the
        Soviet regime intensified social and political life of people.</p>
    <p>This was especially clearly manifested in the implementation of land and
        water reforms in Spring 1921.
        </p>
    <p>The Young Communist League and the trade unions played an important role
        in society =>social and political life involved thousands of people from remote
        areas of the country</p>
    <p>Creation of a broad network of educational and cultural institutions was the
        good indicators of development </p>
    <p><b>NEP</b></p>
    <p>The experience of NEP recognizing the need for commodity-money relations restored
        economy of Kazakhstan in 4-5 years. NEP was a model of reconstruction of social,
        economic relations with combination of various features of socialism and capitalism</p>
    <p>New economic relations were active in the industry = > companies were divided into
        several groups: private traders, cooperatives and those subject to liquidation.</p>
    <p>In Kazakhstan collectivization was accompanied by decentralization; Stalin’s
        administration considered Kazakhstan as a grain source => the aim was an urgent
        transformation of pastoralists to farmers and resease pastures for new farming land
        areas.</p>
    <p>Idea of settling nomads was implemented in an accelerated pace (ускор.темп):</p>
    <p><b>Consequences of collectivization</b></p>
    <p>The process of liquidation of the kulaks and bays => forced unification of the
        collective farms
        </p>
    <p>By 1930 more than 3000 farms were liquidated. Only in 1931, 6,765 people
        were sent to kulak exile (ссылка) from Kazakhstan
        </p>
    <p>After the adoption of the law “On Protection of Property of the State
        Enterprises and Collective Farms, Strengthening of Public Property” 33,345
        people were convicted in Kazakhstan.</p>
    <p><b>Contradictions and consequences of Soviet reforms in
        Kazakhstan in the second half of the XX Century and the
        policy of “perestroika” in Kazakhstan</b></p>
    <p>End of the war and the restoration of the post-war economy caused an increase
        in the social, political and labor activity of citizens. </p>
    <p>An unconscious surge of love of freedom and democracy in the minds of people
        frightened the power structures, and a totalitarian machine began to work again
        to persecute potentially dissenting citizens. The next stage of political repression
        began, which primarily affected the intelligentsia.</p>
    <p>Expression of national consciousness was suppressed. In January 1947, the Central Committee of the
        Communist Party adopted a resolution "On political mistakes in the work of the Institute of Language
        and Literature of the Academy of Sciences of the Kazakh SSR." All works of oral and written literature
        of the pre-revolutionary period were assessed as reactionary and anti-popular. The persecution of
        writers who received the label of bourgeois nationalists began (M, Auezov, S. Mukanov, K. Zhumaliev,
        E. Ismailov and others).
        </p>
    <p>With the death of I. Stalin, a fierce struggle for power began in the upper echelons of the
        administrative management. Since March 1953, the country has been ruled by a triumvirate: N.
        Khrushchev, G. Malenkov, L. Beria (was soon arrested and shot). The intraparty rivalry ended in the
        victory of N. Khrushchev, who became First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee. </p>
    <p>(March 1953: I.Stalin passed away => struggle for his position => G.Malenkov, V.Molotov, L.Beria,
        N.Khruschev)</p>
    <p>In February 1956, the XX Party Congress was held in Moscow, which exposed the personality cult of
        Stalin. Fulfilling the decisions of the Congress on overcoming the consequences, the country's
        leadership released and rehabilitated from prisons and camps millions of people - victims of political
        repression.</p>
    <p>At the congress, N. Khrushchev recognized the peaceful existence of two political systems, socialist
        and capitalist.</p>
    <p>The Khrushchev decade from 1954 to 1964 went down in history as the “Khrushchev thaw”. For the
        first time in the years of Soviet power, the country's leadership changed its policy towards the
        agricultural sector.</p>
    <p>Catch up and overtake the States</p>
    <p>N.S Khrushchev is the only Soviet leader who was removed by a simple vote
        by members of the Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee. </p>
    <p>However, he was responsible for the "Caribbean Crisis" (1962). Thus, the
        "Khrushchev decade" was distinguished by an extremely inconsistent policy,
        on the one hand, democratic reforms in the political, economic and social
        spheres, and on the other hand, by the adoption of subjective decisions. </p>
    <p>All sectors of the economy were characterized by extremely unproductive resource intensity.</p>
    <p>From 1965 to 1985, the republic turned into one of the largest industrial regions of the
        country. The main base of nonferrous metallurgy was located in Kazakhstan, a fuel and
        energy complex, a developed chemical industry, a coal mining industry operated, there was a
        huge potential for oil production. </p>
    <p>Representatives of the intelligentsia, whose views, reflected in works
        of literature and art, did not fit into the ideology of the system (were
        persecuted).</p>
    <p>Such a fate, for example, befell the talented book of the poet O.
        Suleimenov "Az i Ya". The poet was accused of overestimating the
        role of the Turks in history.</p>
    <p><b>Ecological problems</b></p>
    <p>The irrational use of natural
        resources during the existence of the
        Soviet regime led to an increase in
        environmental problems in
        Kazakhstan. Nuclear tests since 1949
        at the Semipalatinsk test site have
        led to radiation pollution of a huge
        territory in Central and Eastern
        Kazakhstan. </p>
    <p>Another environmental problem was
        the catastrophic shallowing of the
        Aral Sea, which was caused by the
        irrational use of the waters of the
        Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers. </p>
    <p>The fall in the level of the Aral Sea,
        the transformation of the seabed
        into a salt desert have turned this
        region into a cluster of serious
        environmental and social problems.</p>
    <p>The first mass all-republican independent organization was the anti-nuclear
        movement "Nevada-Semipalatinsk". This organization arose on the initiative of
        the poet O. Suleimenov and quickly spread throughout Kazakhstan.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this movement → close the Semipalatinsk and other nuclear test
        sites. </p>
    <p>On August 29, 1991, the polygon was closed</p>
    <p><b>“Perestroika” in Kazakhstan</b></p>
    <p>Mid 80s => crisis in the Soviet system => realization of reforms in economic strategy</p>
    <p>By the mid-1980s, the USSR found itself in a deep economic, political and social crisis</p>
    <p>In 1985 M.S.Gorbachev marked proclamation of a new policy in internal affairs =>
        “Glasnost”, “Acceleration” and “Perestroika</p>
    <p>In April 1985, under his leadership, a regular plenum of the CPSU Central Committee
        took place, from which the period of the largest political, economic, ideological and
        social upheavals in the largest country in the world begins. This period lasted 7 years
        and went down in history as "Perestroika"</p>
    <p>stage - 1987-1988 The slogans “more democracy” and “glasnost” became the leitmotif of this stage.</p>
    <p>stage - 1989-1990 The period of "confusion and vacillation". It is characterized by a split in the
        previously unified camp of perestroika, a transition to open political, national confrontation.</p>
    <p>Stage - 1990-1991 This stage was marked by the collapse of the world socialist system, the political
        bankruptcy of the CPSU and the collapse of the USSR.</p>
    <p>In April 1985 Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU => a course proclaimed to
        "accelerate the socio-economic development" of the USSR on the basis of the
        advanced development of mechanical engineering.</p>
    <p>In the political field, the 27th Congress of the CPSU held in 1986 limited itself to calls
        to improve socialist democracy. The failure of all undertakings was revealed already at
        the beginning of 1987.</p>
    <p><b>March 1986 => 27th Congress of CPSU =></b></p>
    <p>The development of economic reforms was determined by two
        trends: the expansion of the independence of state enterprises
        and the expansion of the scope of the private sector of the
        economy. In 1986, the Law on Individual Labor Activity was
        adopted, which legalized private entrepreneurial activity. For the
        first time in many decades, officially permitted "private traders"
        appeared in the USSR = > </p>
    <p>Inconsistent reforms = > crisis in agriculture</p>
    <p>In 1987, the Law “On State Enterprise” was adopted, according to
        which state-owned enterprises were transferred to cost accounting,
        self-sufficiency and self-financing could independently conclude supply
        contracts with partners, some large enterprises were allowed to enter
        the foreign market.</p>
    <p>In 1988, the law "On cooperation in the USSR" was adopted. Finally, in
        1989, land leases were allowed for a period of 50 years.</p>
    <p>In the political field M. Gorbachev introduced a new
        concept into the political vocabulary - glasnost, by which the
        authorities understood "healthy" criticism of existing
        shortcomings, greater awareness of the population and
        some weakening of censorship</p>
    <p>The actual political reforms were initiated by the 19th
        All-Union Party Conference (summer 1988). At the
        conference, M. Gorbachev suggested extending
        alternative elections to the party, combining the post of
        first secretary of the party committee with the post of
        chairman of the Council of People's Deputies. And,
        most importantly, the conference approved creation of
        the position of President of the USSR. This reform led
        to the establishment of a new system:</p>
    <p>Representative power and executive power:</p>
    <p>Congress of People's Deputies of the USSR President of the USSR</p>
    <p>Supreme Soviet of the USSR</p>
    <p>Finally, in the fall of 1990, Mikhail Gorbachev proposed to the Supreme Soviet
        his own compromise Program for the transition to a market, which also did not
        work. The crisis was growing. Mikhail Gorbachev's authority in the country
        began to decline rapidly.</p>
    <p>1988 - 1991 were also marked by fundamental changes in the foreign policy of
        the USSR. As a result of three meetings of Mikhail Gorbachev with US
        President R. Reagan, agreements were reached on the destruction of medium
        and short-range missiles; in 1988, the withdrawal of Soviet troops fro</p>
    <p>The December events in 1986 were the result of serious
        contradictions between the originally proclaimed goals and the
        realities of the day. The reason for them was the change of the
        top leadership of Kazakhstan</p>
    <p>On December 15, 1986, a member of the CPSU Central Committee G.
        Razumovsky and the first secretary of the Ulyanovsk regional party committee
        G. Kolbin arrived in Alma-Ata. On the morning of December 16, the Plenum
        of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan took place. </p>
    <p>Instead of D.Kunayev, G.V. Kolbin was elected, who did not work in the republic before his
        election and was not known to the absolute majority of the population. That is, the head of
        the republic was elected a person who was not only not connected with Kazakhstan and did
        not know the local conditions, but was not even registered with any of the local party
        organizations and did not have a Kazakh residence permit. This was perceived as an insult to
        the Kazakh people and sparked a spontaneous protest.</p>
    <p>On the morning of December 17, 1986,
        young people began to gather on the
        square in front of the Central
        Committee building in Alma-Ata,
        demanding an explanation of the
        reasons for the election of G. Kolbin
        and protesting against Moscow's
        ignorance of the republic's interests. </p>

        foreign policy.</p>
    <p>This period was marked by the establishment of a unified Kazakh citizenship</p>
    <p>Dec.20, 1991 the “Law on Citizenship of the Republic of Kazakhstan” was
        adopted.</p>
    <p>January 1992: Kazakhstan joined the Organization for Security and Co-operation in
        Europe on 30 January 1992. During the first years of its independence, Kazakhstan
        needed the support of the world powers and authoritative international
        organizations, including the OSCE. At the same time, the world community was
        interested in the constructive foreign policy line followed by the young republic,
        which, as history willed it, had turned out to be the possessor of the fourth largest
        nuclear arsenal. Mindful of this, the country made a conscious choice in favor of
        balanced approaches in its foreign and domestic policies, in which a pivotal role was
        assigned to the strategy of multilateral partnership and liberalization of the economy
        and society.</p>
    <p>March 1992: Kazakhstan UN member is a significant milestone in the history
        of Kazakhstan, which marked the recognition of the country’s independence
        by the world community. 30 years ago Kazakhstan became the 168th
        member state of the United Nations, the Kazakh Ministry of Foreign Affairs
        said in a statement on March 2.</p>
    <p><b>4th stage = > from Jan. 28,1993 to Aug. 30, 1995</b>the First Constitution of
        independent Kazakhstan was adopted on January 28, 1993. </p>
    <p>From Aug.30 1995 = > a new stage in state building begins. Second
        Constitution of Kazakhstan was adopted. This Constitution had laid the
        fundamental of the new state, formed a single state with the power to
        regulate and guide social development.</p>
    <p>The President was granted the powers of the constitutional arbiter ensuring
        coordination of the functioning of all branches of government and their
        responsibility for people. </p>
    <p>The current Constitution was one of the major achievements = > on its basis
        on Dec.9 first elections in Parliament were held. The upper house is the
        Senate and the lower is the Majilis.</p>
    <p><b>An important manifestation of the new Kazakhstan
        statehood became the symbols of the RK</b>
    </p>
    <p>Symbols of Kazakhstan are the evidence of its sovereignty, unity of people and
        authorities.</p>
    <p>They express the idea of Kazakhstan’s statehood, consolidation and aspiration
        to national and universal values</p>
    <p>The purpose of state symbols are = > integrity, independence, unity of people
        and cooperation with neighbor countries.</p>
    <p>On June 4, 1992 the President Nazarbayev signed the Law “On the State Flag
        of the Republic of Kazakhstan”, “On the State Emblem of the Republic of
        Kazakhstan” and “On the Musical version of the State Anthem of the Republic
        of Kazakhstan”.</p>
    <p>On Dec 11,1992 the text of the National Anthem was approved.</p>
    <p>The author of the national flag is
        an artist <b>Shaken Niyazbekov</b>. The
        flag = > is rectangular cloth of
        blue color with the image of sun
        with rays in the center, eagle an
        national ornament.</p>
    <p>Pure blue color of the national flag
        indicates the cultural and ethnic
        unity of the people and at the
        same time points the idea of the
        indivisibility of the state. </p>
    <p>The light if the source of life and
        energy. The sun rays on the flag
        has form of grain is percept as
        abundance and prosperity.</p>
    <p>Formation of Kazakhstan’s independence = > adoption of the Constitutional Law of the
        Republic of Kazakhstan “On the State Independence of the Republic of Kazakhstan” on
        Dec.16, 1991 which became a logical continuation of the constitutional norms
        originating of the Declaration on State Sovereignty.
        </p>
    <p>The main provision of the Constitutional Law were revealed in seven chapters
        consisting of 18 articles. Article 1 of this document states that the Republic of
        Kazakhstan is an independent, democratic and legal state, independently defining and
        supporting domestic and foreign policy and has integral, indivisible and inviolable
        territory.
        </p>
    <p>It is stated that the revival and development of culture, traditions and language,
        strengthening the national dignity of the Kazakh nation and people of other
        nationalities living in Kazakhstan as one of the most important duties of the state.</p>
    <p>The final regulations
        state that the
        Republic of
        Kazakhstan shall have
        state symbols – the
        coat of arms, flag and
        anthem;
        </p>
    <p>Almaty was defined
        as the capital of the
        country.</p>
    <p>The flag, the coat of
        arms, anthem and the
        borders are main
        components of the
        state.</p>
    <p>On Dec. 21, 1991 presidents of 11 states signed the Alma-Ata Declaration. The
        Independent States declared that “with the formation of the Commonwealth
        of Independent States (CIS), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics no longer
        exists”.</p>
    <p>Construction of Kazakhstan statehood in the 1st half of 1990s was carried out
        in the strategic, institutional and symbolic aspects.
        </p>
    <p>After the legal registration of the independence of the Republic of Kazakhstan
        a number of priorities were raised = > creation of government institutions,
        recognition of a state in the international arena/relations and its membership
        in various international organizations and unions.</p>
    <p>Th strategic goal of the development of a sovereign state was developed with
        a strong presidential power == >
        </p>
    <p>Efficient functioning of social and political institutions</p>
    <p>Definition and strengthening of state borders</p>
    <p>Solution of urgent problems and reforms</p>
    <p>Establishment of institutional structures to support the society</p>
    <p>These tasks were developed in the “Strategy of Formation and Development
        of Kazakhstan as a Sovereign State” prepared by N.A.Nazarbayev in 1992.</p>
    <p>This strategy = > basis for the development policy guidelines related to selfdetermination of the people of Kazakhstan. </p>
    <p>Since the first days of independence Kazakhstan declared its firm
        commitment to the norms and principles of international law. President
        N.Nazarbayev set the following targets as foreign policy: “First of all, we
        declare the peaceful orientation of its policies and declare that we have no
        territorial claims to any state of the world”. </p>
    <p>Kazakhstan supports ideas of existing borders, non-interference in internal
        affairs of other states.</p>
    <p>Legal registration of the border is guarantee of compliance with 2 basic
        principles of the international law:</p>
    <p>The principle of inviolability of borders and</p>
    <p>The principle of territorial integrity of the state. </p>
    <p>Thus, the policy of our state is based on principles and norms of international
        law, domestic law and international practice
        </p>
    <p>At the same time the state border defines the territory in which the Republic
        of Kazakhstan has full sovereign rights.</p>
    <p>With the independence of our
        country its diplomatic service had
        task to identifying and registration
        of the state with neighboring
        countries. The process of
        establishment of diplomatic
        relations were in 1992-1995.</p>
    <p>It was held in several directions:
        with China, with the Central Asian
        states, Russia and Europe.</p>
    <p>On December 16, the Constitutional Law on State Independence was adopted, from
        that day the countdown of a new stage in the history of Kazakhstan - “The Era of
        Independence", as the First President - Elbasy Nursultan Nazarbayev called it in the
        book
        </p>
    <p>Fundamental documents were adopted, Kazakhstan appeared on the world map as a
        country with clearly defined borders, acquired its own army, created the governing
        structures necessary for an independent state and approved all state symbols.</p>
    <p>Interethnic peace and harmony is our common achievement and great value, which
        largely determines the social life of the country and the course of its recent history.</p>
    <p>The Kazakhstani model of the civil world is not accidentally received international
        recognition. Today in our country there are 140 nationalities and 17 confessions
        coexist peacefully. We are all one people, each of us is a part of it.</p>
    <p>Quote from “The Era of Independence“, N.A.Nazarbayev.</p>
    <p><b>DECREE ON
        STRATEGY FOR FORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF KAZAKHSTAN AS A SOVEREIGN STATE
        May 16, 1992</b></p>
    <p><b>IN POLITICAL LIFE:
    </b></p>
    <p>Сreation of a multi-party system that deepens democratic transformations
        and contributes to the consolidation of a multinational society, nominating
        new political figures and leaders</p>
    <p>Ensuring stability as the main political goal, as a necessary condition for the
        successful implementation of economic reforms (especially during the
        transition period)</p>
    <p>Taking into account geopolitical self-determination, of multilateral and
        diverse military-political and economic balances ensuring the security and
        sovereignty of Kazakhstan</p>
    <p><b>In economics:</b></p>
    <p>The formation of a social market economy based on competitive principles,
        with a combination and interaction of the main forms of ownership (private
        and state), each of which will perform its functions in the general system of
        economic and social relationships;</p>
    <p>Creation of legal and other conditions for the implementation of the principle
        of economic self-determination of people;</p>
    <p>Consumer market. This is the main way to enhance motivation to work,
        improve the quality of life of every Kazakhstani family and create social
        stability;</p>
    <p>Attraction and effective use of foreign investments for the development of
        Kazakhstan
        </p>
    <p>Social responsible entrepreneurship, healthy competition, reasonable
        participation of foreign investors</p>
    <p>Progressive structural restructuring of the economy; overcoming its
        technological backwardness is ensured by choosing the right priorities and
        their implementation on the basis of the created mechanism of economic
        stimulation of the development of individual industries.</p>
    <p>An important element of the strategy is the step to revival and development
        of Kazakhstan. The "Rapid Development Strategy" should become the
        economic ideology of the entire society</p>
    <p><b>In social development</b></p>
    <p>Creation of a society in which the well-being of all will be ensured in practice;</p>
    <p>Increase in labor income, pensions and benefits; its integration into world economic
        relations</p>
    <p>Kazakhstan has a clearly expressed social orientation, creates equal conditions and
        opportunities for everyone as the basis for a stable development</p>
    <p>Provision of social guarantees for unemployment</p>
    <p><b>In Foreign Policy:</b></p>
    <p>The specifics of the geopolitical position and ethno-demographic composition, the level of
        economic development and military construction of Kazakhstan make it not military, but
        political means dominating in ensuring its security, relying primarily on its own forces and
        reasonable, balanced diplomacy</p>
    <p>The lack of direct access to the open sea makes it difficult to participate in international
        economic relations. Therefore, it is extremely important to maintain mutually beneficial friendly
        relations based on the principles of complete trust with neighboring states, primarily with
        Russia and China (which are for us the gateway to world communications)</p>
    <p>Development of cooperation with European Union-member states; United
        States,Turkey, Pakistan, India, Iran, Asia-Pacific region, South and
        Southeast Asia, the Middle East</p>
    <p>During 1990-1991 the Parliament adopted laws “On property in the Kazakh SSR”,
        “On the basic principles of foreign economic activity of the KazSSR”, “On free
        economic zones in the KazSSR”, “On foreign investments in the Kazakh SSR”.</p>
    <p>In 1990, the “Program for the Stabilization of the Economy and the Transition to
        Market Relations” was adopted, which provided for the privatization of state
        property as the main condition for the transition to the market. The privatization of
        state property was supposed to be carried out in two stages. </p>
    <p>The first - the so-called “small privatization” - provided for the transfer of public
        housing to private ownership through the so-called coupon mechanism. The
        second is “big privatization” = = > transfer of the rest of state property to the
        private ownership of citizens.</p>
    <p>In the 1st half of 1992, the leadership of the republic worked out the main strategic
        directions of the socio-economic development of Kazakhstan, set out in the work of
        N. Nazarbayev “Strategy for the formation and development of Kazakhstan as a
        sovereign state”</p>
    <p><b>In the field of economics, the following goals were supposed to be achieved:</b></p>
    <p>the formation of a social market economy based on competitive
        principles, with a combination and interaction of the main forms of
        ownership (private and state), each of which will perform its functions
        in the general system of economic and social relationships;</p>
    <p>creation of legal and other conditions for the implementation of the
        principle of economic self-determination of a person;</p>
    <p>introduction of the national currency and ensuring its internal and then
        external convertibility;</p>
    <p>the conquest of its own or division with other countries of specific positions in the
        world commodity markets based on the natural resources of Kazakhstan and the
        reconstruction of its economy due to the advanced development of processing and
        science-intensive industries, export and import-substituting industries with the
        involvement of modern foreign and domestic equipment and technologies;
        </p>
    <p>consumer market;</p>
    <p>attraction and active use of foreign investments for the development of
        Kazakhstan.</p>
    <p>The chronological framework for achieving the main economic goals:</p>
    <p>1992-1995: denationalization, privatization of property and saturation of the consumer market with goods.
        </p>
    <p>1996-2005: gradual overcoming of the raw material orientation of the economy,
        accelerated development of the transport network and telecommunications, the
        formation of developed commodity and foreign exchange markets, other markets -
        capital, labor, securities, intellectual property</p>
    <p>The third stage, according to the authors of the strategy, lasting 5-7 years will be
        characterized by the accelerated development of the open economy, the
        achievement on this basis of the strategic goals of the transition period, the
        strengthening of Kazakhstan's position in world trade and entry into the category
        of new industrial states.
        </p>
    <p>The President noted the factors both promoting and hindering the implementation
        of socio-economic tasks = = >
        </p>
    <p>a wide range of minerals, creating a reliable raw material basis for almost any
        type of production;
        </p>
    <p>large areas of agricultural land and arable land, allowing Kazakhstan, after the
        reform of land relations, to become an exporter of food.</p>
    <p>The presence of a
        sufficiently developed
        production potential and a
        competent contingent of
        workers in all sectors
        </p>
    <p>Center of scientific
        discoveries, ideas and
        inventions.
        </p>
    <p>Negative aspects:</p>
    <p>Raw materials orientation
        of the economy;</p>
    <p>Environmental pollution in
        many regions;
        </p>
    <p>Infrastructure lagging;</p>
    <p>Lack of new technologies.</p>
    <p>In March 1993, N. Nazarbayev summed up the total of the first stage (1991-1993)
        of privatization (small privatization). The number of employees at privatized
        enterprises was only 12% of the number of employees. The planned plans for the
        privatization of the state housing stock, trade and consumer services were not
        fulfilled.</p>
    <p>In trade, privatized enterprises accounted for only 4.5% of retail turnover,
        although 40% of their total number was privatized. In consumer services, the
        private sector provided only 21% of services instead of the planned 50%.</p>
    <p>In March 1993: Decree of the President = = > the National Program of
        Denationalization and Privatization in the Republic of Kazakhstan for 1993-1995</p>
    <p>According to the Program, all state property was divided into two groups:</p>
    <p>objects subject to denationalization and privatization;</p>
    <p>objects, the privatization of which is prohibited.</p>
    <p>The second group = > the land, airspace, flora and fauna - everything that is the exclusive property of the
        state.</p>
    <p>In April 1993, the Supreme Soviet approved the program of urgent anti-crisis measures and deepening socioeconomic reforms proposed by the government of S. Tereshchenko (Prime-minister). The main task of the
        government was to achieve macroeconomic stabilization, accelerate the transformation of property and
        create a competitive market environment</p>
    <p>The course towards creating a competitive
        economic model was set by the Address of
        President N.A. Nazarbayev to the people of
        Kazakhstan in March 2006. In this Address,
        the Strategy for the country's entry into the
        list of the 50 most competitive states was
        formulated, and at present, the economic
        policy of Kazakhstan is being implemented
        taking into account the need for a
        progressive increase in national
        competitiveness.</p>
    <p>The need to improve competitiveness in
        modern conditions is determined by the
        constantly increasing processes of
        globalization of world economic relations
        and the integration of Kazakhstan into the
        world economy</p>
    <p>About 80% of the country's GDP, which indicates a high level of
        involvement of the national economy in the global economic system.
        In the context of a high export orientation and dependence of the
        Kazakhstani economy on global markets, the problem of increasing
        competitiveness becomes especially important, since the dynamics of
        its development and the growth of the welfare of citizens directly
        depend on how competitive the country's economic model will be.</p>
    <p>Kazakhstan is ahead of other CIS countries, and in some (the volume of foreign
        investment, GDP growth rates) it is among the world leaders;</p>
    <p>Until now, the primary source of economic growth remains the raw materials
        sector accumulating most of the investments;
        </p>
    <p>It is planned to adjust the Kazakh economic model in order to shift the emphasis to
        non-resource sectors, which will allow Kazakhstan to occupy more promising
        niches in the global economic system and increase competitiveness;</p>
    <p>Currently, the competitiveness of a country is determined by the productivity of its
        economic system, and the level of well-being of citizens, and many other factors
        that are not limited to the trade sphere.</p>
    <p><b>“Nurly zhol” Programme</b></p>
    <p>On November 11, 2014: President’s annual Address to the people of Kazakhstan = > New Economic Policy
        of Kazakhstan – “Nurly Zhol”;</p>
    <p>The President in his Address “Nurly Zhol” determines not only strategic aims, but also sets specific goals for
        the Government:</p>
    <p>I. It is necessary to additionally allocate
        additional resources for concessional lending
        to small and medium-sized businesses, as
        well as large businesses.</p>
    <p>II. To attract new investment it is necessary to
        improve the relevant conditions. It was
        instructed to develop the infrastructure of the
        special economic zones Khorgos – “Eastern
        Gate” and the “National Industrial
        Petrochemical Technopark” in Atyrau and
        Taraz.</p>
    <p>III. To continue the construction of the
        EXPO-2017 complex, it was instructed to
        allocate additional funds for lending</p>
    <p>IV. Further development of the transport
        infrastructure of Astana, to increase the
        potential of the capital's airport.</p>
    <p>The President in his Address
        defined not only the goals, but
        also offered proposals. The
        President drew attention to the
        fact that for the development of
        the economy we need new
        initiatives to stimulate business
        activity and employment. </p>
    <p>The core of the New Economic
        Policy is the Infrastructure
        Development Plan:</p>
    <p>1) Development of transport and
        logistics infrastructure</p>
    <p>2) Industrial infrastructure
        development.</p>
    <p>3) Energy infrastructure development.</p>
    <p>4) Modernization of housing and
        communal services infrastructure and
        water and heat supply networks.</p>
    <p>5) Development of social
        infrastructure.</p>
    <p>6) It is necessary to continue working
        to support small and medium-sized
        businesses and business activity.</p>
    <p>The message noted that the new Economic Policy
        “Nurly Zhol” will become the engine of the
        growth of our economy in the coming years.
        Construction of roads alone will create 200,000
        new jobs. And this means employment and
        growth of incomes of the population.
        </p>
    <p>Nurly Zhol will have a multiplier effect on other
        sectors of the economy: production of cement,
        metal, machinery, bitumen, equipment and related
        services.</p>
    <p>The first years of Independence were difficult for the people of Kazakhstan and for our young state. During
        this time, there were many disputes about the correctness of the path of development chosen by our
        country, often the ability of Kazakhstan to independently cope with all the problems was questioned</p>
    <p>During the years of independent development Kazakhstan has surpassed CIS neighbors in a
        number of social reforming areas: pension, banking, credit and financial systems, housing, partly
        education, healthcare and social security</p>
    <p>Therefore, Kazakhstan as a leader in social reform = > social modernization, suitable to all our
        partners in the Eurasian integration.</p>
    <p>Main purpose of social modernization is to prepare society for life in the new industrial and
        innovation-based economy, to find an optimal balance between the economic development of
        Kazakhstan and the provision of public goods, to establish social relations based on principles of
        law and justice.</p>
    <p><b>Modernization
        of social and
        economic
        fields life
        </b></p>
    <p>To develop and implement a system of quality standards
        for social and professional qualifications of Kazakhstanis,
        especially the economically active population.
        </p>
    <p>To create an effective model of social-labor relations
        based on partnership between state, private and
        professional associations.</p>
    <p>Self-organization should be developed from early life,
        including local self-government; to "modernize" the civil
        society institutions, which should become effective tools
        for implementing social initiatives of citizens.</p>
    <p><b>Thirdly, the principle of partnership participation.</b></p>
    <p>All work must be based on close cooperation between government, business and citizens. The task
        of the state power is to ensure a rational balance between the interests of the state, society and the
        individual.</p>
    <p><b>Fourthly, the principle of incentive = ></b> today the global trend of social development is to move to a

    <p>A significant rise in the Kazakh economy occurred due to the expansion of
        production capacities in the oil sector and the growth of world oil prices;</p>
    <p>Economic growth was immediately reflected in the living standards of people.
        This happened both due to the revival of the economy and the emergence of new
        jobs, and due to the systematic increase in government spending on the social
        field;</p>
    <p>•In his Message to the people of Kazakhstan "Towards a free, effective and secure
        society"
        , President Nursultan Nazarbayev noted that the country was able to maintain
        stability and gain moment for economic growth, the highest in all CIS countries, only due
        to the reforms that were carried out in nine years of Independence.</p>
    <p>Since the crucial role of the raw materials sector, primarily the oil and gas industry →
        further development of the country, it was equally important to determine the correct
        strategy in the development of the oil industry and the use of revenues from it</p>
    <p>In 2000, work continued to improve legislation, primarily in the field of public
        administration and in the field of economics. Processes of reforming practically all state
        and public institutions took place. </p>

    <p><b>Ethno-demographic processes and strengthening of interethnic
        harmony, socio-political development prospects and spiritual
        modernization in Kazakhstan</b></p>
    <p>The priorities for ensuring interethnic and interfaith harmony are reflected in the
        programmatic work of President N.A. Nazarbayev "Ideological consolidation of society
        as a condition for the progress of Kazakhstan", the Development Strategy of
        Kazakhstan until 2030, the Concept of Formation of the State Identity of the Republic
        of Kazakhstan. This topic is comprehensively disclosed in the books of the Head of
        State "In the Stream of History", "Critical Decade", his reports at sessions of the
        Assembly of the People of Kazakhstan and other speeches.</p>
    <p>The diaspora policy of Kazakhstan after gaining independence
        focused on attracting ethnic Kazakhs to the territory of
        Kazakhstan. This is seen as a factor of state stability aimed at
        preserving national identity.</p>
    <p>The Assembly of the People of Kazakhstan (until
        2007, the Assembly of the Peoples of Kazakhstan)
        was established by the Decree of President
        Nursultan Nazarbayev of March 1, 1995. </p>
    <p>The change in the name of the assembly in 2007
        (from the Assembly of Peoples to the Assembly of
        the People of Kazakhstan) was, first of all, to
        symbolize the unity of the people of Kazakhstan,
        despite its ethnic diversity</p>
    <p>The Assembly of the People of
        Kazakhstan is an advisory body and is
        subordinate to the President of the
        Republic of Kazakhstan. </p>
    <p>The activities of the Assembly of the
        People of Kazakhstan are aimed at
        developing draft laws and
        implementing state national policy in
        the field of interethnic relations,
        ensuring social and political stability
        in the republic and increasing the
        efficiency of interaction between state
        and civil institutions. </p>
    <p>In May 2007, amendments were made
        to the Constitution of the Republic of
        Kazakhstan, after which the Assembly
        of the People of Kazakhstan acquired
        the status of a constitutional body</p>
    <p>The Assembly received the right to elect 9 deputies of the Mazhilis of
        Parliament from among its ranks, which increased its social and political
        significance. </p>
    <p>On October 20, 2008, the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan signed the
        Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan "On the Assembly of the People of
        Kazakhstan", according to which it became a full-fledged subject of the
        country's political system, and the legal framework governing its life was
        determined.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of the third millennium, independent and secular Kazakhstan was one
        of the first among the subjects of international law to take responsibility and in practice
        began to seriously and responsibly promote a global dialogue between the leaders of
        world and traditional religions</p>
    <p>This was facilitated by the social practice itself and the new realities that arose from
        this, requiring the need to recognize the religious renaissance and the inadmissible use
        of the religious factor as a secondary one, subordinate to group, social or other interests.
        During this difficult period, Kazakhstan formulated three main constants of its domestic
        policy - <b>peace, harmony and consolidation</b></p>
    <p>First President - Elbasy Nursultan
        Nazarbayev initiated = > unique format of
        the Congress of Leaders of World and
        Traditional Religions, recognized by the
        entire civilized world as a unique
        platform for dialogue and cooperation.</p>
    <p>18 years have passed since the historical time when in the young
        capital of independent Kazakhstan, located in the heart of the
        Eurasian continent - the city of Astana, <b>on September 23-24,
        2003</b>, the First Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional
        Religions was held, for the first time in the entire modern history
        of mankind, gathering 17 delegations from Europe, Asia, the
        Middle East and America representing Christianity and Islam,
        Judaism and Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism and Shintoism.</p>
    <p><b>Main goals of the
        Congress:</b></p>
    <p>Search for common human
        landmarks in world and
        traditional forms of religions;</p>
    <p>Functioning of a permanent
        international interfaith
        institution for the dialogue of
        religions and the adoption of
        agreed decisions.</p>
    <p><b>Priorities of the Congress</b></p>
    <p>Establishment of peace,
        harmony and tolerance as the
        permanent principles of human
        existence;
        </p>
    <p>Achieving mutual respect and
        tolerance between religions,
        confessions, nations and ethnic
        groups;</p>
    <p>Preventing the use of religious
        feelings of people for the
        escalation of conflicts.</p>
    <p>The uniqueness of our
        country also lies in the fact
        that from the very moment
        of the formation of
        independent Kazakhstan,
        <b>ensuring interethnic peace
        and harmony</b>, which are the
        historical basis of the state
        national policy of the
        republic, has been given
        priority attention by the
        state</p>
    <p>The essence of interreligious dialogue
        was clearly formulated by the Leader
        of the Nation Nursultan Nazarbayev
        at the First Congress: “We do not
        need, and indeed we cannot, set any
        ultimate goals. You cannot create a
        single religious space. It is impossible
        to completely overcome the existing
        differences, especially since
        sometimes they affect the foundations
        of great religions. <b>However, the value
        of constant dialogue lies in the fact
        that, despite the existing
        disagreements, the very meaning and
        the process of searching for a certain
        "golden mean" remain.</b> And most
        importantly, dialogue creates a
        territory of peace and harmony, a
        time of harmony and clarity“.</p>
    <p>The danger of further developments in this vein is deeply realized by the participants
        of the Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions, who strive to establish a
        broad dialogue to develop a new paradigm of international security and development.
        It should be based on the principles of equality, mutual respect, recognition of each
        other's interests, cooperation, tolerance and mutual understanding.</p>
    <p>The final documents of the interreligious summit adopted by the participants of the
        Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions - appeals, declarations and
        statements calling on representatives of all religions and ethnic groups for a peaceful
        dialogue, for constructive cooperation between religions, and for the prevention of
        conflicts based on cultural and religious differences - are of considerable importance.</p>
    <p>That is why the Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions today is still in
        demand at the international level as a unique bridge between East and West, a point
        of continuation of an important interreligious dialogue about the fate of the world and
        the role of religions in its preservation and improvement against the background of
        the spread of conflicts with clear religious overtones, xenophobia, the fight against
        extremism and international terrorism.</p>
    <p>President of the Republic of Kazakhstan N.A.
        Nazarbayev at the last two Congresses of Leaders
        of World and Traditional Religions highly
        appreciated the possibilities of interreligious
        dialogue, both for Kazakhstan and for the modern
        world as a whole. The Address adopted by the
        participants of the IV Congress emphasizes that
        “... the only way to create a safe world is a
        dialogue based on the principles of mutual respect
        and understanding, compassion and forgiveness,
        justice and solidarity, peace and harmony. </p>
    <p>In this regard, we call for the improvement of
        mechanisms of interaction between religious
        communities, political leaders, international
        organizations and civil society.</p>

        strategic tasks of the socioeconomic and political
        modernization of the country</p>
    <p><b>Doctrine of National Unity of Kazakhstan</b></p>
    <p>was developed in order to implement the instructions of the President of the
        Republic of Kazakhstan given at the XIV session of the Assembly of the People of
        Kazakhstan on October 23, 2008 (diaspora populations from many nationalities are
        represented in the Assembly including, Armenians, Belarusians, Chechen-Ingush,
        Germans, Greeks, Koreans, Kyrgyz, Poles and Ukrainians among others)</p>
    <p>The doctrine is based on the provisions of the Constitution, the Law "On the
        Assembly of the People of Kazakhstan" and other regulatory legal acts of the
        Republic of Kazakhstan, as well as the norms of international law in this area.</p>
    <p><b>The purpose of this Doctrine is to determine the priorities and mechanisms
        for ensuring national unity in Kazakhstan on the basis of civic identity,
        patriotism</b>, spiritual and cultural community, maintaining stability, interethnic
        and interfaith harmony in society.</p>
    <p>First of all, this document proceeds from the fact that at the
        present stage of development of Kazakhstan, the social
        harmony and interethnic tolerance achieved over the years
        of its independence should move to a qualitatively new level
        - national unity, based on the recognition of a system of
        values and principles common to all citizens.</p>
    <p><b>Main principles:</b></p>
    <p>1. One country - one destiny.</p>
    <p>2. Different origins - equal opportunities</p>
    <p>3. Development of the national spirit</p>
    <p>The doctrine is the basis for creating an integral system of legal social
        economic, political measures aimed at strengthening the unity of the
        peoples of Kazakhstan, the development of democracy, dialogue of
        cultures and civilizations</p>
    <p>Achievement of National Unity, based on the recognition of a common
        system of values and principles for all citizens → strategic priority.</p>
    <p><b>The policy of forming a new historical consciousness and
        worldview of the people of the Great Steppe</b></p>
    <p>Kazakhstan’s road to independence is a unique phenomenon in the heart of
        Eurasia, which combines elements of the East and the West, of the developing
        and industrialized world. It synthesizes its Turkic and nomadic past, tolerant
        Islam, multiculturalism, and the positive Soviet-era emphasis on education
        and modernization. Its independence is robust, as the country is the most
        successful in Central Asia and among the most successful in the CIS</p>
    <p>Strategy of formation and development of Kazakhstan as a sovereign state
        adopted on May 16, 1992</p>
    <p>Over the years of Independence, Kazakhstan has built a holistic, effective
        system of ensuring the national security, which provided adequate responses
        to all the challenges that the young State had to face. As a result, the
        conditions were created for implementation of the reforms and creative
        development</p>
    <p>The basis of this scientifically based and time-tested system is a number of
        structural changes. These include consideration of the overall development
        strategy of the country, compliance with the goals of the society and the State at
        each historical stage; </p>
    <p>balancing containment of threats and prevention of over-regulation;
        comprehensiveness and consistency, consideration of all types of threats, their
        interrelations; </p>
    <p>orientation not only on the public bodies, but also the social institutions;
        anticipating response to new challenges, adaptability and threat modelling;
        proactivity in the fi eld of the regional and global security</p>
    <p>Kazakhstan ➔ in the world community has significantly strengthened and
        reinforced its position in the international arena due to its historical,
        geographical, economical and social development.
        </p>
    <p>For Kazakhstan which has successfully built a new state, recognized in the
        world having one of the most successful economy in the Central Asian region
        and unique experience of ethnic unity, the nation-state is very relevant.</p>
    <p>It is closely linked with the question of identity and patriotism.</p>

        , published on May 16, 1992 ➔
        main approaches in the foreign policy strategy.</p>
    <p>This article is actually the first attempt to comprehend the country's own path of
        development in difficult conditions.
        </p>
    <p>At the next stage of building the foreign policy of Kazakhstan, the President of the
        country outlined the priorities of the foreign policy program, which were formalized
        in the form of a foreign policy concept that forms ideas about the place and role of
        Kazakhstan in international relations, strategic priorities, goals, objectives of foreign
        policy and methods of achieving them.
        </p>
    <p>Diplomatic relations with 186 countries;</p>
    <p>Kazakhstan’s foreign policy concept was developed in accordance with
        the provisions recommended in the address of the President of
        Kazakhstan – the Leader of the Nation “Strategy” Kazakhstan – 2050:
        “New political course of the Established State”;</p>
    <p>It is a system of fundamental views on principles and approaches, goals,
        priorities and objectives of the foreign policy of Kazakhstan</p>
    <p>Priorities of the foreign policy of Kazakhstan: Russia, China, USA,
        EU, Central Asia and the Islamic world.</p>
    <p>The renunciation of nuclear weapons eventually became the “visiting
        card” of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the world stage. This is evidenced
        by the numerous initiatives of the First President of the Republic of
        Kazakhstan on denuclearization. </p>
    <p>The path traversed by Kazakhstan in the field of disarmament, in turn,
        finds positive assessments among the leaders of a number of foreign
        states. Thus, according to former US President Barack Obama, President
        Nazarbayev is one of the exemplary leaders in the world in matters of
        nonproliferation and nuclear security. “Kazakhstan is an excellent
        example of how a country can renounce nuclear weapons and achieve
        greater security and economic prosperity,” he said.</p>
    <p>Concept of foreign policy of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2020-2030 was
        updated last year by the new leadership of the country and contains a number
        of innovations related to changes in the global environment, focusing on the
        crisis of confidence and increasing conflict among various actors, erosion of
        the principles of international law</p>
    <p>Special attention in the new Concept of Kazakhstan's foreign policy is paid to
        multi-vector diplomacy and cooperation within the framework of such
        organizations as the United Nations, Organization for Cooperation and
        Security in Europe, Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Eurasian
        Economic Union, etc</p>
    <p>The foreign policy concept of the
        Republic of Kazakhstan for 2020-2030
        ➔ goals and objectives reflected in
        the Strategy for Long-Term and
        Sustainable Development until 2050,
        the Plan of the Nation “100 Concrete
        Steps to Implement Five Institutional
        Reforms” and the President's annual
        messages to the people of Kazakhstan.</p>
    <p>Over the years of independence, our country has
        strengthened its position in the international
        arena, has established itself as a peaceful and
        open state, a reliable partner in global and
        regional affairs. Kazakhstan implements a multivector, pragmatic and proactive foreign policy,
        makes a significant contribution to the formation
        and implementation of a global and regional
        agenda in the field of security, cooperation and
        development. </p>
    <p>At the same time, the main attention is paid to the
        all-round and defense of national interests,
        constructive promotion of foreign policy and
        foreign economic priorities</p>
    <p>We can definitely talk about the continuity of the course of Elbasy in the
        foreign policy of the current Head of State. Thus, mutually beneficial
        cooperation with key foreign partners continues, dialogue with the countries of
        Central Asia is intensifying, and close attention is paid to international security
        issues.</p>
    <p><b>The Republic of Kazakhstan implements its foreign policy based on the following basic
        principles:</b></p>
    <p>1) continuity of the foreign policy course of the First President - Elbasy N.A. Nazarbayev at a new
        stage of the country's development;</p>
    <p>2) assistance in building a stable and democratic world order; equal integration into the world political,
        economic and humanitarian development; effective protection of the rights, freedoms and legitimate
        interests of Kazakhstanis;</p>
    <p>3) promoting the external openness of the state, creating favorable external conditions for increasing
        the level of well-being of Kazakhstanis, developing the political, economic and spiritual potential of the
        country;</p>
    <p>4) multi-vector, pragmatism and proactivity, meaning the development of friendly, equal and mutually
        beneficial relations with all states, interstate associations and international organizations of practical
        interest to Kazakhstan;</p>
    <p>The modern system of international relations is
        undergoing a complex transformation, the main features of
        which are:</p>
    <p>Low efficiency of mechanisms for preventive diplomacy and conflict
        settlement;</p>
    <p>the erosion of the fundamental principles of international law;</p>
    <p>aggravation of traditional challenges and threats to security, such as terrorism,
        extremism, arms race, including missile, nuclear and space, climate change;
        etc</p>
